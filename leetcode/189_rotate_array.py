"""
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

[show hint]

Hint:
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

===============================
Without doing it in-place it's one liner. In-place is two liners. Even that is slow.
The triple reverse technique is clever.
