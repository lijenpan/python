Problem Statement
=========

Write a function to compact a string in place:

* strip whitespace from the string.
* remove duplicate characters if they are next to each other

My initial response was this can only be done in C++ because just about any other high level languages such as C# and Java, strings are immutable. So they cannot be edit in place. But I thought you are looking for Pythong/Django developer? The hiring manager responded "well how would you solve this in Python?" At this point, I came to the realization that wow this guy never programmed a damn thing in his life. He probably just memorized the answer one of his engineers gave him. So I gave him a solution that is almost a in place solution in Python.
